Helper to store git credentials inside 1password.

## Installation

### Dependencies

To use this helper you need to install the 1password command-line tool (>=2.8.0) ([download](https://support.1password.com/command-line-getting-started/#set-up-the-command-line-tool))
and of course git.  
You also need to setup the command-line tool with your 1password account ([guide](https://support.1password.com/command-line-getting-started/#get-started-with-the-command-line-tool)).

brew tap develerik/tools
brew install git-credential-1password
```

- `git-credential-1password`: The latest release
- `git-credential-1password-bin`: The latest release (prebuild)
- `git-credential-1password-git`: Builds the current `main` branch

### From Source
